<title>COBOL Tools</title>

<h1>COBOL Tools</h1>
COBOL is an old language but still with limited tool support: there exist compilers and (limited) IDEs, but that's pretty much it, at least as far as I know.
<div>No pretty-printers, no documentation generators, no refactoring tools, limited interaction with other environments...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I happen to work in a software migration company that is highly involved in the migration of legacy COBOL code, it is in my own interest to make working with COBOL &nbsp;more easy and flexible...</div>
<div>A side note: todays commercial COBOL offerings (MicroFocus's ServerExpress etc., Fujitsu's NetCOBOL, IBM's Enterprise COBOL) are very expensive!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Therefore, and also just for proving to myself that better stuff is possible, I'm going to create a set of COBOL-focused tools:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul><li><b>Preprocessor</b><br />
Just a 'normal' COBOL preprocessor which will expand copybooks and apply REPLACE actions. This in itself is a useful tool in the light of working with other preprocessors (e.g. SQL preprocessors) which cannot see 'beyond' a COPY statement. Moreover, the basic functionality (tokenization, COPY/REPLACE-interpretation) included in a preprocessor will be needed in all other tools anyway.</li>
<li><b>Documentation Generator</b><br />
Similar in spirit to javadoc and doxygen, this will generate an interlinked web-site for a COBOL project, providing an overview of all files, programs, sections, paragraphs and variables that are part of the projects.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Pretty Printer<br />
<span style="font-weight:normal">Reformat a COBOL source file according to a configurable set of layout settings.</span></b></li>
<li><b>Static Analyzer</b><br />
A static analyzer in the footsteps of findbugs, pmd, checkstyle which will analyze complexity metrics and check for duplicate code and a range of other potential issues.</li>
<li><b>Batch Editor</b><br />
A tool which allows to script certain edit actions to a COBOL source, similar in spirit to sed but instead of being text/line oriented only, this tool should also be able to find locations based on the recognition of actual COBOL syntax. The edit actions will be: insert-before, insert-after and replace.</li>
<li><b>Advanced Search</b><br />
As a fundamental building block for the 'batch editor', but also useful in itself: a tool that can search for the occurrence of certain COBOL syntax in a set of COBOL sources. The general search should be based on a mix of using regular expressions on actual COBOL grammar descriptions. Next to that, a set of preconfigured 'searches' will be available including: all usage locations of a variable, all call locations of a program, all copy locations of a copybook, ...</li></ul>
<div>If I ever get here, there are two possibilities:</div>
<div>
<ol><li>I'm completely fed up with COBOL and this is it! Stop. Basta.</li>
<li>Or I start working on my own <b>COBOL compiler</b>: probably compiling to Java bytecode or .NET CLI.</li>
</ol>
