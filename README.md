# Giovanni Pellicciotta

I'm a developer and this is the place I keep random notes and thoughts about development and technology.

Organization:
- In [links](links) I keep links to interesting articles and tools.
- In [notes](notes) I keep technical notes and descriptions of workarounds for specific issues.
- In [ideas](ideas) I keep development ideas: a simple short list in [dev-project-ideas](ideas/dev-project-ideas.md)
  and more worked-out ideas in separate docs.
