# Getting Things Done (David Allen)

## Executive Summary
Get everything out of your head.   
Make decisions about actions required on stuff when it shows up - not when it blows up.   
Organize reminders of your projects and the next actions on them in appropriate categories.   
Keep your system current, complete, and reviewed sufficiently to trust your intuitive choices about what you're doing (and not doing) at any time.

## The System

_Capture, clarify and categorize_ everything that comes in on a DAILY basis:
  1. Stuff comes into 'in' baskets (email, mail, desk, whatsapp, ...)
  2. Immediately categorize the stuff:
  3.   If it is __NOT__ actionable:
         3a. Move to trash
         3b. Store as reference
         3c. Store on 'Someday/Maybe' list (as idea)
  4.   If it is __ACTIONABLE__: determine the next action and:
         4a. Do immediately if less than 2'
         4b. Write on appropriate action list:
             - _Waiting for_ if waiting for somebody else
             - _Calendar_ if needs to happen on specific day/time
             - Other action list with correct context

_Organize_ by:
  1. Having a good system for keeping reference material
  2. Having action lists that are always available for review and editing
  3. Having a project list (and associated project reference material)

_Review_ regularly:
  1. DAILY check calendar, tickler file and other actions lists
  2. WEEKLY check projects list (and determine new 'next action's) and individual projects for next action
  3. WEEKLY check 'waiting for' list
  4. QUARTERLY check 'someday/maybe' list

## Natural Planning Model

1. Why   - Boundary Context: Define purpose, goals and principles (= give others 100% free reign as long as...)
2. What  - Visualize Succesfull Outcome: Determine a vision of desired outcome
3. How   - Gather Approaches: Brainstorm to determine possible approaches (no judgement, no organization, quantity first)
4. When  - Organize ideas into a plan: identify important parts, sort by priorities/components/sequences, work out details
5. Start - Identify next actions

## Practical Guidelines

- IN box should be empty as it means everything is categorized
- Weekly review is best done on Friday's to clear mind before weekend
- All the following should be put on a calendar:
  - Day/time specific actions/tasks
  - Day-specific reminders (e.g. start preparing for birthday)
  - Time-specific decision reminders (e.g. go to conference or not: if 'yes', need to sign up)
- Interruptions are inevitable
- Multi-tasking is impossible
- Always handle first what's most on your mind
- Ceasing negative imaging, will increase energy
- Having too much to do is OK as long as agreements can be renegotiated
- Each interaction (e.g. meeting) should end with "What's the next action"
- Each agreement should end with "What does 'done' mean?"

### Agreements
- How to prevent a _broken agreement_?
  - Don't make it
  - Keep it and do it
  - Renegotiate the agreement

### Action lists 
- Must always be available for editing and use: paper or digital
- Should allow action selection based on:
  - context (geographical, social)
  - time availability
  - energy availability
  - priority

### The Fundamentals
- 2' rule: do immediately
- zero-inbox
- what's the next action
- lists as external mind

## Definitions
- Project: a project is anything with a clear goal, a clear 'done' state and needing more than 1 action to accomplish
- Ticker file: a sort of physical calendar with 31 day folders and 12 month folders
  Looking ahead 31 days and 12 months and cycling every day: emptying current day.

## Links to Psychology
- Mind is _good_ at having ideas
- Mind is _bad_ at storing ideas: need external memory
- Uncompleted tasks take up room in the mind, limiting clarity and focus
- Flow happens when:
   - skills match challenge
   - there is intrinsic motivation 
   - goals are clear
   - there is immediate feedback
- PsyCap = Psychological Capital:
   - self-efficacy: confidence to take on challenging tasks
   - optimism
   - hope: presevering towards goals
   - resilience: overcoming adversity and problems   

## GTD Mastery

2. Graduate Level
   - Complete list of projects
   - Clear view of roles, accountabilities and interests
   - Projects as "driver" and reflection of accountabilities and interests
   - Translate anything into achievable outcomes and next actions   

3. Post-graduate Level
