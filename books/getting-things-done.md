# Getting Things Done (David Allen)

## Executive Summary
Get everything out of your head.   
Make decisions about actions required on stuff when it shows up - not when it blows up.   
Organize reminders of your projects and the next actions on them in appropriate categories.   
Keep your system current, complete, and reviewed sufficiently to trust your intuitive choices about what you're doing (and not doing) at any time.
