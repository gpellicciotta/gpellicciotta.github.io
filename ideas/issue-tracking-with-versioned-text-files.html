<title>Issue-tracking via Text Files under Version-Control</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Issue-tracking via Text Files under Version-Control</h1>
<p>A simple issue-tracking system based on text-files under version-control.</p>
<p>The key idea is that every ticket (= issue or enhancement request) will correspond to a single text file, which is stored in a version-control system (e.g. subversion).</p> 
<p>Other (general) concepts:
</p><ul>
  <li>Tickets can be edited in a wiki-like fashion, allowing for editing (i.e. correction) of previous comments and even the merging of multiple comments.</li>
  <li>As tickets are just text-files, they can be stored alongside a project's other artifacts (source code, documentation, ...) and fit naturally in the project's VCS repository. The proposed directory name is 'tickets'.</li>
  <li>A ticket is just a document with separate sections for the different comments made on the ticket and some extra meta-data: name, short description, status, severity, ... Only the first three of these must be predefined, all other types of meta-data can be configured on a project-per-project basis.</li>
</ul>

     Description
     ===========
     
     The automatic import of tickets from a Bugzilla 3.* database should
     be created. It should be possible to import either all or a subset of 
     the bugzilla issues stored in a Bugzilla database.

     This is harder than I though: I need to find someone who can explain the bugzilla 
     database schema first.
